# XTools

This python package is meant to provide a wealth of useful functionality for MITx and HarvardX research. The goal is to streamline the tedious processes in munging data, displaying figures, and analysis as well as provide a shared standard for our work.

## Directories
Currently the package is divided into 5 subpackages (open to improvements):

- <strong><code>figures:</code></strong> - A collection of classes and functions for displaying figures, in order to provide easy replication. This submodule contains all of the code necessary for generating the [MITx Course Reports](http://web.mit.edu/ir/mitx/reports.html)
- <strong><code>mongo:</code></strong> - Classes for creating, reading and storing data in MITx and HarvardX mongo databases
- <strong><code>munge:</code></strong> - Common processes for manipulating data
